# Parallel-Coordinates
Application of parallel coordinates to visualize and analyze multidimensional data 


 ## Implementation:
 Parallel coordinates can be implemented with multiple software, such as:

Software | About the Program | Example Code 
--- | --- | ---  
[Xdat] |A free parallel coordinates software |   [Example_Xdat](https://github.com/randerson112358/Python/blob/master/simple_returns.py) | 
[Python package] | Yellowbrick is a diagnostic visualization platform in python which include parallel coordinates visualization | [ExampleCode_in-Python]
[R package] | Parallel coordinates charts can be built with R using the ggally packages and its ggparcoord() function | [ExampleCode_in-R]
[Matlab package] | Matlab use parallelplot package to visualize parallel coordinates charts | [ExampleCode_in-MatLab]
