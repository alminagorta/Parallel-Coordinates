 # Software:
 Parallel coordinates can be implemented with multiple software, such as:
 * [Xdat] : A free parallel coordinates software
 * [Python package] : Yellowbrick is a diagnostic visualization platform in python that provides multiple alternatives to visualize data. One of the is parallel coordinates 
 * [R package] : Parallel coordinates charts can be built with R using the ggally packages and its ggparcoord() function
 * [Matlab package] : Parallel coordinates charts can be built with MAtlab using parallelplot package
