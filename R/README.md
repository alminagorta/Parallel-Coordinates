# Implementation of Parallel Coordinates using R

There are multiple libraries in R to implement parallel coordinate plots, some of these include:

* [Plotly]
* [ggally]
 
Here, we provide an example using Plotly because its interactivity in the web

[Plotly]: https://plotly.com/r/parallel-coordinates-plot/
[ggally]: https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/parallel-plot-ggally.html

## How to use it

* Make sure your computer have R installed and Plotly library. 
* Select the main variables from the input table
* Run the [R code] to input the data and create the parallel coordinates [Fig1]

## Example Application

A parallel coordinates plot was implemented using data from [Ontario Freshwater Fishes Life History Database]. A [subsample] of the data was selected to 
implement this approach.
