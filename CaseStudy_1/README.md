# Implementation of Parallel Coordinates using Python

There are multiple libraries in Python that we can be used to implement parallel coordinates, some of these include:

* [Plotly]
* [Yellowbrick]
 
Here, we provide an example using Plotly because its interactivity in the web

[Plotly]: https://plotly.com/python/parallel-coordinates-plot/
[Yellowbrick]: https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/features/pcoords.html

## How to use it

* Make sure your computer have Python installed and Plotly library. You can install Plotly from [here]
* Select the main variables from the input table [Fig1]
* Run the Python and use [this code] to input the data, and create the parallel coordinates: 

[here]: https://pypi.org/project/plotly/
[this code]: https://github.com/alminagorta/Parallel-Coordinates/blob/master/Python/II_coorde_GitHub_python.py

## Example Application

A parallel coordinates plot was implemented using data from [Ontario Freshwater Fishes Life History Database]. A [subsample] of the data was selected to 
implement this approach.
